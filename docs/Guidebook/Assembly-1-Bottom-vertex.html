<p>We shall start our construction by using our M5 tap and die set to thread the 2060 and 2040 extrusions. Take your time and use enough lubrication.</p>

<p>Next put the M5x10 bolts through the bottom vertices from the inside-out and attaching the DIN 439 M5 nuts on the outside, do not tighten these bolts yet!</p>
<p>[<em>Image of bottom vertex with M5 bolts and nuts</em>]</p>
<p>Now insert 4x DIN 439 M5 nuts into the single slot rail of your aluminiums extrusions, these will be needed later.</p>

<p>Next, on the same side of all your vertices, insert the 2060 aluminium extrusion over the DIN 439 M5 nuts and push them all the way to the end against the corner.</p>
<p>When placed correctly you can now insert 3x M5 bolts to fasten the newly threaded holes of the 2060 aluminium extrusion to the bottom vertex.</p>

<p>Next you can fasten the inside of the M5 bolts so it tightens it's grip on the aluminium extrusions.</p>
<p>Next we attach the stepper motors to the vertices, grab your stepper motors and use 4x M3x? bolts to attach them to the bottom vertex.</p>
<p>Make sure the stepper motor connectors are to the side, otherwise you will barely be able to reach them later on when connecting the wires.</p>

<p>After you've tightened all the bolts on your stepper it's time to mount the bed mount to the bottom vertices. Use 4x M4x? bolts to mount the bed mount and at the same time use 2x M5x10 bolts to also attach it to 2 of the 4 loose DIN 439 M5 nuts in the 2060 aluminium extrusion.</p>
<p>[<em>Image of bottom vertex with M4 bolts and M5 bolts attached</em>]</p>
<p>You should now have 3 identical vertices that each have a 2060 aluminium extrusion and a stepper motor attached and have 2x DIN 439 M5 nuts loose in the top of the rails as shown.</p>

<p>Alright, let's move on to the the next step. Assembling the top vertices.</p>
