<p>Now it's time to make some Illuminati signs out of the parts you just built.</p>
<p>If you have not already done so, put the rest of the M5x10 bolts through the vertices from the inside-out and attaching the DIN 439 M5 nuts on the outside, do not tighten these bolts yet...again! (I sense a pattern here)</p>
<p>Now slide the vertices into each other, do this at the same time or the parts will not fit.</p>
<p>[<em>Image of half connected vertices</em>]</p>
<p>Now keep working and slides the aluminium extrusions over the bolts untill again they hit the ends of the vertices and then bolt them in the threaded holes you made with M5x10mm bolts.</p>
<p>[<em>Image of fully connected vertices</em>]</p>
<p>Repeat these steps for the other vertices.</p>
<p>Done both halves? Alright, let's move on to the the next step. Assembling the frame.</p>
